This repo is a collection of Architecture and Design Patterns. Currently tehre are four implementations:

#1 CircuitBreaker: Improved implementation of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker

#2 TemplatePipelineAsCode: This class implements the Template Pattern in Pipelines As Code

#3 CommodityNodejsPipelineAsCode: This class implements a concrete NodeJS commodity 

#4 State Pattern: allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. Colo to finite state machines, similar to an implementation of the strategy pattern.

TODOs: 
#a Some methods have little variations so they can be implemented in teh base class too, e.g.: git clone, publish to an APIm management system, etc

#b Add implementation of delegate System.Action
